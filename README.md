The undertaking we're undertaking is Dishcovery is an innovation and design thinking project aimed at transforming the café discovery journey. 
With the help of the café finder system Dishcovery, customers may choose cafés that suit their tastes. When users provide their location, preferred meal type, or café references,
 the system uses TF-IDF vectorization and collaborative filtering to suggest the closest cafés that meet their requirements. 
The backend, which is written in Python and uses Flask,
 cleans and vectorizes a café dataset to provide recommendations more effectively. 
With the help of an eye-catching user interface (UI) composed of HTML, CSS, and JS, users can easily input their preferences and get a list of cafés that are recommended to them
. Personalized results are guaranteed by the creative application of collaborative 
filtering, which displays café names, locations, prices, reviews, and menus.
